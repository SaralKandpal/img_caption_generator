# img_caption_generator

This project (Image caption generator) is made by using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long short term memory). The image features will be extracted from Xception which is a CNN model trained on the imagenet dataset and then feeding the features into the LSTM model which will be responsible for generating the image captions.
